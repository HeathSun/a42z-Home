# a42z - a Manifesto

Computing technical trust. At scale.

## What is a42z?

> In a world where anyone can fake a demo, we exist to verify what's real.
> 

**a42z is not just a brand. It’s a bet.**

A bet that **truth matters** in an era flooded with demos, hype, and synthetic signals.

A bet that **real technology should speak for itself.**

We’re building the **technical trust layer** for the age of AI.

Where others judge projects by pitch decks, we read the code’s heartbeat.

Where others accept screenshots, we verify models in motion.

Where others see hype, we see signal.

## Why “42”?

Because **42 is the answer to everything**, and in our world, it’s the start of something bigger:

> The quest for computable trust.
> 

Where a16z changed how capital flows,

**a42z** changes how trust is earned.

## Our Mission

> To build the protocol of technical trust for the age of generative hype.
> 

In the AI century, pitch theatre must die.

Only builders should rise.

We believe:

- Real tech has a trace.
- Real builders leave signal.
- And signal, if parsed right, becomes truth.

We are **a42z**.

We read between the lines of hype.

We are the signal engine of the AI century.
